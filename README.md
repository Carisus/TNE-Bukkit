=============
**If you're looking for a lightweight economy plugin download [The New Economy Lite](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/tnelite/).**  

**Please Note: This project is in Alpha stage, and may therefore contain multiple bugs. Please report any bugs you find.**  

About
----------
The New Economy was originally a hMod Plugin made by Noobaholic. After reading multiple requests on the Bukkit Forums for the plugin, which Noobaholic replied that he was too busy at the moment to port it to Bukkit, I decided to port it to Bukkit. The New Economy is a feature-packed economy plugin that is currently still under heavy development. I hope to provide a visual data editor for TNE flat file saves soon.
